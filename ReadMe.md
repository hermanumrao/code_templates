# Code Templates

A collection of template files to help you start coding with best practices.  
These templates provide boilerplate and handy scripts for various languages and setups so you can avoid repetitive setup work.

---

## Contents

This repository includes templates and scripts for:

- **C / C++** — basic project skeletons, Makefile, CMakeLists etc.  
- **Python** — starting templates, script layouts.  
- **WebDev** — HTML/CSS/JS starter files.  
- **Shell** — handy bash scripts (both simple and more advanced).  
- **Other build tools** — Makefile etc.

---

## Why Use These Templates

- Speed up project setup  
- Ensure consistency across projects  
- Help enforce structure / good practices from the start  
- Save time by not reinventing boilerplate

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hermanumrao/code_templates.git
```

2. **Browse the templates**
   Go into the folder matching your language / purpose, e.g. `python/`, `cpp/`, `webdev/`.

3. **Copy or fork the needed template**
   Copy the directory or files you need into your new project and modify as required.

---

## Usage Examples

* For starting a new C++ project: copy the template from `cpp/` which contains `CMakeLists.txt` etc.
* For a new web front-end: use the HTML/CSS/JS skeleton from `webdev/`.
* For scripting tasks: use the shell scripts provided.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have templates you think others will find useful, feel free to open a pull request:

* Add new template files or tweaks to existing ones
* Follow consistent naming / directory structure
* Include comments in templates to aid understanding

## Notes / Tips

* Customize templates to your workflow early (e.g. add your preferred linters, code styling configs).
* Keep templates minimal to avoid dragging unnecessary dependencies.
* Version control your customized templates if you keep evolving them.
